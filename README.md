# skin_weight_management_tool
Python tool for maya that allows user to manage the number of joints affecting their skinned meshes.
Managing skin weights is an important part of the rigging process, and it can be easy for rogue weights be found in places where they should be, from joints far away. This tool provides a quick and easy way to set the maximum number of influences affecting a skinned mesh. 

Users can select multiply skinned meshes at once to instantly tune the number of joints influencing each vertex to their desired number, or they can manually select the vertices they'd like to change, allowing for fine tune control of skin weighting.
